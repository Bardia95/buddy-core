== Introduction

Buddy *core* module is dedicated to cryptographic api.

Including:

- cryptographic hash algorithms (digest)
- key derivation algorithms (kdf)
- digital signatures
- message authentication (mac)
- block ciphers
- stream ciphers


== Project Maturity

Since _buddy-core_ is a young project there can be some API breakage.


== Install

This section covers the _buddy-core_ library installing process and its requirements.


=== Requirements

_suricatta_ is tested with these platforms:

- JDK7
- JDK8


=== Leiningen

The simplest way to use _suricatta_ in a clojure project, is by including it in the dependency
vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

._on project.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
[buddy/buddy-core "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
----

=== Gradle

If you are using gradle, this is a dependency line for gradle dsl:

[source,groovy]
----
compile "buddy:buddy-core:0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"
----

=== Get the Code

_buddy-core_ is open source and can be found on link:https://github.com/funcool/buddy-core[github].

You can clone the public repository with this command:

[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/funcool/buddy-core
----


== Hash algorithms (digest)

All hash algorithms are located in the `buddy.core.hash` namespace.

.Available hash algorithms
[options="header"]
|===============================================
| Hash algorithm name  | Digest size
| SHA1                 | 160
| SHA2                 | 256, 384, 512
| SHA3                 | 256, 384, 512
| MD5                  | 128
| Tiger                | 192
|===============================================


=== Basic usage

.Import namespace example:
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.hash :as hash])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
----

.Usage examples:
[source, clojure]
----
(hash/sha256 "foo bar")
;; -> #<byte[] [B@162a657e>

(-> (hash/sha256 "foo bar")
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "fbc1a9f858ea9e177916964bd88c3d37b91a1e84412765e29950777f265c4b75"
----


=== Advanced usage

Hash functions are implemented using protocols and can be extended
to other types. The default implementations come with support
for file-like objects (*File*, *URL*, URI* and *InputStream*).

.Make hash of file example:
[source, clojure]
----
;; Additional import for easy open files
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

(-> (hash/sha256 (io/input-stream "/tmp/some-file"))
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "bba878639499c8449f69efbfc699413eebfaf41d4b7a7faa560bfaf7e93a43dd"
----

You can extend it for your own types using the
*buddy.core.hash/Digest* protocol:

[source,clojure]
----
(defprotocol Digest
  (make-digest [data algorithm]))
----

[NOTE]
Functions like *sha256* are aliases for the more generic
function *digest*.


== Mac algorithms

Buddy comes with three mac implementations: *HMac*, *SHMac* and *Poly1305*.

=== HMac & SHMac

There are two variants of hmac: simple and salted. Both are available
in the `buddy.core.mac.hmac` and `buddy.core.mac.shmac` respectively.

==== Basic usage

[source, clojure]
----
;; Import required namespaces
(require '[buddy.core.mac.hmac :as hmac])
(require '[buddy.core.mac.shmac :as shmac])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

;; Generate sha256 hmac over string
(-> (hmac/hmac "foo bar" "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "61849448bdbb67b39d609471eead667e65b0d1b9e01b1c3bf7aa56b83e9c8083"

;; Same example but using salted variant
(-> (shmac/shmac "foo bar" "salt" "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "bd5f7a0040430a73f4845bac8f980c6398b4baae8a22efcc22038be0f4dd9678"
----

The key parameter can be any type that implements the *ByteArray* protocol
defined in the `buddy.core.codecs` namespace. It comes with default implementations for
`byte[]` and `java.lang.String`.


==== Advanced usage

Like hash functions, hmac is implemented using Clojure
protocols and comes with default implementations for: String, byte[],
*File*, *URL*, *URI* and *InputStream*.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io])

;; Generate hmac for file
(-> (io/input-stream "/tmp/somefile")
    (hmac/hmac "mysecretkey" :sha256)
    (bytes->hex))
;; -> "4cb793e600848da2053238003fce4c010233c49df3e6a04119b4287eb464c27e"
----

You can extend it for your own types using `buddy.core.mac.hmac/HMac` protocol:

[source,clojure]
----
(defprotocol HMac
  (make-hmac [data key algorithm]))
----


=== Poly1305

Poly1305 is a cryptographic message authentication code
(MAC) written by Daniel J. Bernstein. It can be used to verify the
data integrity and the authenticity of a message.

The security of Poly1305 is very close to the block cipher algorithm.
As a result, the only way for an attacker to break Poly1305 is to break
the cipher.

Poly1305 offers cipher replaceability. If anything goes wrong with
one, it can be substituted by another with identical security
guarantees.

Unlike *HMac*, it requires an initialization vector (IV). An IV is
like a salt. It should be generated using a strong random number
generator for security guarantees. Also, the IV should be of the same
length as the chosen cipher block size.


==== Basic usage

The default specification talks about AES as default block cipher,
but buddy comes with support for three block ciphers: AES, Serpent
and Twofish.

.Make mac using Serpent block cipher with random IV
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer [bytes->hex]])
(require '[buddy.core.mac.poly1305 :as poly])
(require '[buddy.core.keys :refer [make-random-bytes]])

(let [iv  (make-random-bytes 16)
      mac (poly/poly1305 "some-data" "mysecret" iv :serpent)]
  (println (bytes->hex mac)))
;; => "1976b1c490c306e7304a59dfacee4207"
----

== Public/Private keypairs

Before explaining digital signatures, you need to read public/private
keypairs and convert them to usable objects. Buddy has limited support
for reading:

- RSA keypair
- ECDSA keypair


=== RSA Keypair

An RSA keypair is obviously used for RSA encryption/decryption, but it
is also used for making digital signatures with RSA-derived
algorithms.

.Read keys
[source,clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])

;; The last parameter is optional and is only mandatory
;; if a private key is encrypted.
(def privkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.3des.rsa.pem" "secret")
(def pubkey (keys/public-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))
----

.Generate a RSA Keypair using openssl.
[source,bash]
----
# Generate AES-256 encrypted private key
openssl genrsa -aes256 -out privkey.pem 2048

# Generate public key from previously created private key.
openssl rsa -pubout -in privkey.pem -out pubkey.pem
----


=== ECDSA Keypair

Like RSA keypairs, ECDSA is also used for making digital signatures
and can be read like in the RSA examples.

.Read keys.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])

;; The last parameter is optional and is only mandatory
;; if a private key is encrypted.
(def privkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.ecdsa.pem" "secret")
(def pubkey (keys/public-key "test/_files/pubkey.ecdsa.pem"))
----

.Generate a ECDSA Keypair using openssl.
[source, bash]
----
# Generate a params file
openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -out ecparams.pem

# Generate a private key from params file
openssl ecparam -in ecparams.pem -genkey -noout -out ecprivkey.pem

# Generate a public key from private key
openssl ec -in ecprivkey.pem -pubout -out ecpubkey.pem
----


== Digital Signatures

Digital Signatures differ from Mac as Mac values are both generated
and verified using the same secret key. Digital Signatures require a
public/private keypair. It signs using a private key and verifies a
signature using a public key.


=== RSASSA PSS

RSASSA-PSS is an improved probabilistic signature scheme with
appendix. What that means is that you can use a private RSA key
to sign data in combination with some random input.

link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt[rfc3447.txt]

.Sign sample string using rsassa-pss.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.rsapss :as rsapss])

;; Read private key
(def rsaprivkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.3des.rsa.pem" "secret"))

;; Make signature
(def signature (rsapss/rsapss "foo" rsaprivkey :sha256))

;; Now signature contains a byte[] with signature of "foo" string
----

.Verify signature using rsassa-pss.
[source, clojure]
----
;; Read private key
(def rsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(rsapss/verify "foo" signature rsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


=== RSASSA PKCS1 v1.5

RSASSA-PSS is an probabilistic signature scheme with appendix.
What that means is that you can use a private RSA key to sign data.

link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3447.txt[rfc3447.txt]


.Sign sample string using rsassa-pkcs.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.rsapkcs :as rsapkcs])

;; Read private key
(def rsaprivkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.3des.rsa.pem" "secret"))

;; Make signature
(def signature (rsapkcs/rsapkcs15 "foo" rsaprivkey :sha256))

;; Now signature contains a byte[] with signature of "foo" string
----

.Verify signature using rsassa-pkcs.
[source, clojure]
----
;; Read private key
(def rsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.3des.rsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(rsapkcs/verify "foo" signature rsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


=== Eliptic Curve DSA

Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is a variant of the
Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic curve cryptography.

.Sign sample string using ecdsa.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.keys :as keys])
(require '[buddy.core.sign.ecdsa :as ecdsa])

;; Read private key
(def ecdsaprivkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/privkey.ecdsa.pem" "secret"))

;; Make signature
(def signature (ecdsa/ecdsa "foo" ecdsaprivkey :sha256))
----

.Verify signature using ecdsa.
[source, clojure]
----
;; Read private key
(def ecdsapubkey (keys/private-key "test/_files/pubkey.ecdsa.pem"))

;; Make verification
(ecdsa/verify "foo" signature ecdsapubkey :sha256))
;; => true
----


== Key Derivation Functions

Key derivation functions are often used in conjunction with non-secret parameters
to derive one or more keys from a common secret value.

*buddy* commes with several of them:

.Supported key derivation functions.
[options="header"]
|==============================================================================
|Algorithm name | Constructor              | Notes
|HKDF           | `buddy.core.kdf/hkdf`    | HMAC based KDF
|KDF1           | `buddy.core.kdf/kdf1`    |
|KDF2           | `buddy.core.kdf/kdf2`    |
|CMKDF          | `buddy.core.kdf/cmkdf`   | Counter Mode KDF

|DPIMKDF        | `buddy.core.kdf/dpimkdf` | Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode KDF
|==============================================================================

[NOTE]
====
All key derivation functions work with byte arrays. For the
following examples, the functions in `buddy.core.codecs` convert
strings to byte arrays.
====


=== HKDF

HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is implemented according to IETF RFC 5869

.Example using hkdf
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
(require '[buddy.core.kdf :as kdf])

;; Using hkdf derivation functions. It requires a
;; key, salt and optionally info field that can
;; contain any random data.

(let [kfn (kdf/hkdf (str->bytes "mysecretkey")
                    (str->bytes "mypublicsalt")
                    nil ;; info parameter can be nil
                    :sha256)]
  (-> (kdf/generate-bytes! kfn 8)
      (bytes->hex)))
;; => "0faba553152fce4f"

----


=== KDF1/2

KDF1/2 hash-based key derivation functions for derived keys and ivs as defined by IEEE P1363a/ISO 18033.

.Example using kdf1 or kdf2
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])
(require '[buddy.core.kdf :as kdf])

;; kdf1 and kdf2 are very similar and have the same
;; constructor signature. Requires: key data, salt
;; and hash algorithm keyword.

(let [kfn (kdf/kdf2 (str->bytes "mysecretkey") (str->bytes "mypublicsalt") :sha256)]
  (-> (kdf/generate-bytes! kfn 8)
      (bytes->hex)))
;; => "0faba553152fce4f"
----


=== Counter Mode KDF

Hash-based KDF with counter mode defined by the publicly available NIST SP 800-108 specification.


=== Feedback Mode KDF

Hash-based KDF with feedback mode defined by the publicly available NIST SP 800-108 specification.


=== Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode KDF

Hash-based KDF with Double-Pipeline Iteration Mode defined by the publicly available
NIST SP 800-108 specification.


== Ciphers

Ciphers support in buddy is available on `buddy.core.crypto` namespace.


=== Block Ciphers

In cryptography, a block cipher is a deterministic algorithm operating on fixed-length groups of bits,
called blocks, with an unvarying transformation that is specified by a symmetric key.

.This is a list of currently supported block ciphers in buddy
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| AES               | `:aes`
| Twofish           | `:twofish`
| Blowfish          | `:blowfish`
|========================================

Additionally, for good security, is mandatory to combine a block cipher with some cipher
mode of operation.

.This is a list of currently supported of cipher mode of operation
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| SIC (CTR)         | `:ctr`, `:sic`
| CBC               | `:cbc`
| OFB               | `:ofb`
|========================================

Encrypting data using buddy's crypto primitives is almost as easy. In case of block ciphers, you
should know the block cipher and cipher mode you want to use.

NOTE: currently buddy comes with limited number of ciphers and modes, but in near future
more many more options should be added.

.Example encrypt
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.crypto :as c])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

(let [eng   (c/engine :twofish :cbc)
      iv16  (make-random-bytes 16)
      key32 (make-random-bytes 32)
      data  (hex->bytes "000000000000000000000000000000AA")]
  (c/initialize! eng {:key key32 :iv iv16 :op :encrypt})
  (c/process-block! eng data))
;; => #<byte[] [B@efadff9>
----


=== Stream Ciphers

Stream ciphers differ from block ciphers, in that they works with arbitrary length input
and do not require any additional mode of operation.

.This is a list of currently supported of stream ciphers in buddy
[options="header"]
|========================================
|Algorithm name     | Keywords
| ChaCha           | `:chacha`
|========================================


.Example encrypt
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[buddy.core.crypto :as c])
(require '[buddy.core.codecs :refer :all])

(let [eng   (c/stream-engine :chacha)
      iv8   (make-random-bytes 8)
      key32 (make-random-bytes 32)
      data  (hex->bytes "0011")]
  (c/initialize! eng {:key key32 :iv iv8 :op :encrypt})
  (c/process-bytes! eng data))
;; => #<byte[] [B@efadff9>
----

NOTE: the iv and key size depends estrictly on cipher engine, in this case, chacha
engine requires 8 bytes iv.

NOTE: for decrypt, only change `:op` value to `:decrypt`

You can call `c/initialize` any times as you want, it simply reinitializes the engine.

== Codecs

The codecs implement some useful functions that are widely used around all buddy library. They
consists mainly on functions related conversion between strings, bytes, hex encoded strings
and base64.

The best documentation for this part is the source code.
