  algorithm api has been rewritten and unified
  under `buddy.core.dsa` ns.

  for to be more accurate and more human friendly.

== Version 0.7.0

Date: 2015-09-19

* Set default clojure version to 1.7.0
* Remove slinghsot dependency. buddy.core.crypto ns now raises
  plain instances of clojure.lang.ExceptionInfo.


== Version 0.6.0

Date: 2015-06-28

* Replace `unpad!` function with `unpad` on padding namespace.
  The removed function had wrong name and wrong implementation
  (instead of removing padding, as it name was indicating, it
  replaces the previous padding with zeropading).
* Add `pad` function to paddings namespace.
  This is a side effect free version of the `pad!`.
* Add high level interface for encrypt arbitrary length data
  using an encryption scheme. A initial supported encryption
  schemes are:
** `:aes128-cbc-hmac-sha256`
** `:aes192-cbc-hmac-sha384`
** `:aes256-cbc-hmac-sha512`
** `:aes128-gcm`
** `:aes192-gcm`
** `:aes256-gcm`


== Version 0.5.0

Date: 2015-04-02

* General code refactoring on crypto ns.
* Add support for AEAD block cipher modes.
* Add helper for split data by block size.
* Add support for deflate compression algorithm.
* Add support for AES Key Wrap algorithm.
* Add several fixes on asymetric key reading functions.
* Fix wrong behavior of bytes? predicate.
* Fix unexpected behavior of `count` function of padding algorithms.


== Version 0.4.2

Date: 2015-03-14

* Update bouncycastle version from 1.51 to 1.52


== Version 0.4.1

Date: 2015-02-26

* Remove override warnings on hash and mac related ns (thanks @geraldodev for report it)


== Version 0.4.0

Date: 2015-02-15

New features:

* Add buddy.core.nonce namespace with functions for generate secure random ivs and
  secure nonces.
* Add buddy.core.padding namespace with interface to common padding algorithms.

Changes with backward compatibility:

* Replace record usage in kdf ns with reify.
* Rename kdf protocol method names to more consistent ones.
* Add partial support for nio ByteBuffer for kdf.
* Add common protocol for mac "engine" (this allows low level clojure friendly access to
  the mac algoritm engine) and add implementations of that for hmac and poly1305.
* Add common protocol for hash "engine" (this like mac, allows low level clojure friendly
  access to hash algorithm engines).
* Improve naming on hmac, shmac and poly1305 namespaces using `hash` function instead of algorithm
  name for mac calculation function.
* Unify digital signature function names to: `sign` and `verify`.

Backward incompatible changes:

* Rename kdf protocol from KDFType to IKDF.
* Remove make-random-bytes function from buddy.core.keys ns.
* Improve consistency naming on hash related protocol and its method.
* Remove iv parameter on poly1305 high level abstraction (still available on "engine" constructor).


== Version 0.3.0

Date: 2015-01-18

* First version splitted from monolitic buddy package.
